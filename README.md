 A very cursed fork of [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) that's nessacary for me to be able to do processing on images as they're rendered from markdown.
 All this fork really does is mark most of the methods in the Renderer as async, as well as a couple other small tweaks to make everything work.
